# Changelog

Rule revisions come only from review retrospectives (divergence ≥2 → retrospective
→ revision), recorded here with a version bump.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-06

Direction change, reviewer-driven: "the output diverged from spacex.com — why?"
The 1.x fusion ("skeleton only, keep rounded type and light canvas") kept too
much consulting-deck idiom, and the one adopted SpaceX element (D-DIN in the
data voice) never shipped because the font was declared but not vendored.

- design-rules: decks are **dark-first** (near-black canvas, cold-white ink
  ladder); light canvas stays for long documents.
- design-rules: **D-DIN takes over** as the single Latin face; ALL-CAPS
  display titles at weight 400; rounded faces retired from decks; vendor and
  embed the font — a declared-but-unshipped face renders nothing.
- design-rules: one-statement-per-screen sharpened (giant short headline, one
  support sentence, one centerpiece, thin footer); hairline rows over card
  boxes on dark canvases.
- Accent green lifts to a dark-canvas form (#7C9F63); red text on black uses a
  lifted form while fills keep the seal red.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-06

- design-rules: added three field-tested guards from a reader-reported bug round —
  two-line title budget (shorten, never shrink); icon size independent of
  container scaling (blanket `svg{width:100%}` rules must exclude icons; an
  accidentally-stretched icon is not a design choice); in-row card alignment
  constraints (equalized title heights, stat numbers stacked above labels).
- design-rules: new "Verification matrix" section — language axis × viewport axis
  (design / print / short-laptop); footer rule and page number must be visible at
  every matrix point; height-based media queries as the mechanism. Supersedes the
  standalone localization guard (merged in).

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-06

- Added the localization layout guard to design-rules: translated text runs
  30–50% longer/shorter — re-inspect every fixed-width container page by page
  after any localization pass. (From the English-deck audit: seven layout defects
  found — a wrapped stat band, ragged stat labels, and three SVG text overflows.)

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-06

- **Repository language: English only — declared a red line.** LUMI serves a
  global audience; all rule prose, entry points, adapters, tokens, and this
  changelog are now English. Chinese strings remain only as rule data for
  Chinese-language output (banned phrases, punctuation patterns, collocation
  examples).
- Rules generalized to be output-language-aware: language-agnostic core
  (facts / voice / structure / charts) + a marked [zh-output] module; an
  [en-output] banned-phrase seed added.
- New field-tested layout guard in design-rules: right-anchored labels on
  full-width bars must anchor inside the fill (white-on-white invisibility bug,
  caught in per-page inspection).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-06

Initial release. Rules distilled from six rounds of real delivery polishing and a
first round of reader review on a consulting engagement's deliverables:

- Terminology red lines: no coined Chinese; direct English for concepts without
  an established Chinese term; substring-collision exemptions;
- Banned AI-tell phrases (with the "sales enablement" fixed-collocation lesson);
- Number discipline: sourcing, illustrative labels, repo-wide retraction with
  retirement notes for unreliable citations;
- The "value & future" sales storyline (boundaries converge to one trust page) —
  from a reader review scoring H5=2;
- "So-what is a writing discipline, not a page element" — from a reader review
  scoring H1=1;
- Plain-language scoring anchors ("anchors must be written in the reviewer's
  language") — from a reader review scoring H2=1;
- Five chart iron rules and form selection (partly adapted from
  enterprise-ai-skills, localized);
- Visual tokens v2: space-gray canvas + natural green single accent + China red
  warnings; layout skeleton informed by SpaceX/Tesla research (transparency
  ladder, dual-voice typography, cold-white dark canvas).
